Add captions to the photo gallery on single product pages.

== Description == 

Gallery Captions for WooCommerce adds captions to the photo gallery on WooCommerce's the single-product pages.

The currently displayed image's Title and Caption are displayed below the image, both on the page and in the expanded lightbox view.

== Installation ==

Install the extension by going to the "Plugins" section of your WordPress Admin, click the "Add New" button beside the title, click the "Upload Plugin" button beside the title of the next page, choose the ZIP file you downloaded after purchasing Gallery Captions for WooCommerce, and click the "Install Now" button.

Once the plugin is installed you will be given the option to activate it. It must be activated to work. If you choose not to activate it now you can later by going to "Plugins" in your WordPress Admin and clicking the "Activate" link below Gallery Captions for WooCommerce.

= Configuration =

No configuration is required, or possible. If the plugin is activated captions will be shown, if not no captions will be shown.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure the captions? =

The only configuration is turning the captions on or off. This is accomplished by activating or deactivating the extension on the Plugins page of the WordPress admin.

= How do I set the captions? =

The captions are the image's title and caption. You can edit these in the "Media" section of your WordPress Admin, or when updating the photo gallery for your product.


== Troubleshooting ==


= Image captions may be hidden when different variations are selected =
If product image magnification is on WooCommerce doesn't seem to update the height of the element that contains the images when swapping to a new variation image, so if the new image is taller than the old one some of the content below the image, (and part of the new image itself), may be hidden.

Until this is fixed in WooCommerce the best option is to keep images the same height, or at least the same aspect ratio, (so all square, or all 4:3).
